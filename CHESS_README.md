## API Endpoints

- `GET /` - Main game page
- `GET /api/game-state` - Get current game state
- `GET /api/valid-moves/<row>/<col>` - Get valid moves for a piece
- `POST /api/make-move` - Make a chess move
- `POST /api/new-game` - Start a new game

## Technical Details

### Backend (Python/Flask)
- **ChessGame Class**: Handles all game logic and state
- **Move Validation**: Comprehensive validation for all piece types
- **State Management**: Tracks board state, current player, and game history
- **RESTful API**: Clean API design for frontend communication

### Frontend (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)
- **Responsive Design**: CSS Grid and Flexbox for layout
- **Interactive Elements**: Event-driven JavaScript for user interactions
- **Visual Feedback**: CSS animations and transitions
- **Chess Notation**: Unicode chess symbols for pieces

## Customization

### Styling
The game uses CSS custom properties and modern styling techniques. You can easily customize:
- Colors and themes
- Board size and layout
- Animations and transitions
- Typography and spacing

### Game Logic
The chess logic is modular and extensible. You can add:
- Special moves (castling, en passant)
- Check and checkmate detection
- AI opponent
- Game saving/loading
- Multiplayer support

## Browser Compatibility

- Chrome 60+
- Firefox 55+
- Safari 12+
- Edge 79+

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Check and checkmate detection
- [ ] Castling and en passant moves
- [ ] AI opponent with different difficulty levels
- [ ] Game saving and loading
- [ ] Multiplayer support
- [ ] Tournament mode
- [ ] Move timer
- [ ] Sound effects
- [ ] Dark/light theme toggle

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Port already in use**
   ```bash
   # Change the port in chess_app.py
   app.run(debug=True, host='0.0.0.0', port=5001)
   ```

2. **Flask not found**
   ```bash
   pip install flask
   ```

3. **Board not displaying correctly**
   - Check browser console for JavaScript errors
   - Ensure all files are in the correct locations
   - Verify Flask server is running

### Performance
- The game is optimized for smooth performance
- Large move histories may slow down the UI
- Consider clearing move history for very long games
